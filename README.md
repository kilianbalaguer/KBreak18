## 📱 About

**KBreak18** is a **rootless semi-untethered jailbreak** for iOS 18 devices. It's designed to provide a safe and stable jailbreaking experience while preserving system integrity.

## ⚠️ Development Status

**KBreak18 is currently in development and not ready for public use.**

The jailbreak is not finished yet, which means it won't even jailbreak your device at this stage. **Do not try to jailbreak or use this tool until an official release is announced.**

## ✅ Supported iOS Versions

- **iOS 18.0 – 18.5** (support varies by device)

## 📱 Device Compatibility

### Currently Testing

- iPhone 13 / 13 Pro Max

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Tweak Injection

KBreak18 uses **[ElleKit](https://github.com/opa334/ellekit)** for modern, PAC-safe tweak injection.

### Jailbreak Type

- **Rootless**: Doesn't modify the system partition, making it safer and less likely to cause system instability
- **Semi-untethered**: After rebooting, you'll need to run the KBreak18 app again to re-enable the jailbreak (no computer required)

## ✅ Recommended for Older iOS Versions

For **iOS 15 – 16**, we recommend using **[Dopamine](https://github.com/opa334/Dopamine)** by opa334.
